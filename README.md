# SocketCockpit (SOC)
## Features
- SOC is a client/server socket plugin for DreamOS settop boxes
- SOC allows to implement client/server configurations with multiple dreamboxes. A simple configuration would consist of 2 boxes, one acting as data server and the other one acting as user interface client. With such a configuration the MovieCockpit plugin is able to access the server's movie list and playback movies without the hazzle of configuring samba/nfs network shares and linking video directories.

## Limitations
- SOC supports DreamOS only
- SOC is being tested on DM 920 and DM ONE only

## Installation
SOC will be installed/removed automatically as a dependency. No explicit installation necessary.

## Languages
- english
- german
- italian by Spaeleus
